Working on Server.
	-Need to make classes for message_t's: CONVERSATION_MSGS, CONVERSATION_LIST, FILE, USER_INFO.

FOR LATER:
Think about placing a lock in front() in ThreadSafeQueue and an unlock in popfront() to reduce locking/unlocking of mutex.

Determine how to handle connection time outs. i.e. How long a connection should be idle before the user is timed out.

Separate ServerConnections into different files.

Optimize searching.

Change message parsing to include each user's database IDs.

The incoming and outgoing message queues should be combined into one queue. Any time a message is placed there, a function delegate
should be called that will notify the appropriate target. This may also reduce the need for a queue per connection in favor of one
"global" queue.
