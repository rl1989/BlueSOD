Working on Server.
	-Processing the different types of messages.
		-Request Conversation List message.

After a user logs in, they stay logged in until the server stops receiving pings every XX number of minutes. When the
server receives a message intended for the user, the server will attempt to send it. If it fails to send, it will be logged
into the database. When the user logs back in, the messages in the database intended for that user will be used to populate
a queue and will be sent until there are no more.



FOR LATER:
Determine how to handle connection time outs. i.e. How long a connection should be idle before the user is timed out.

Separate ServerConnections into different files.

Optimize ClientInfoList add, remove and search features.
	-Between vector and list
		*List seems to be more efficient for insertions, but may be slower for searches. Need to figure out which one is more
		 important.
		*It should not be necessary to ever shrink the vector to conserve memory. Not much memory is used by the vector.
		 This will help speed up any future additions to the vector as well.
	-Sorted insert in order to use binary search
