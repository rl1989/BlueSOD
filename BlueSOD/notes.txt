Working on Server.

Need to make UserVerifier use ClientInfo objects for the outgoing deques (i.e. m_verifiedConnections).



FOR LATER:
Determine how to handle connection time outs. i.e. How long a connection should be idle before the user is timed out.

Separate ServerConnections into different files.

Optimize ClientInfoList add, remove and search features.
	-Between vector and list
		*List seems to be more efficient for insertions, but may be slower for searches. Need to figure out which one is more
		 important.
		*It should not be necessary to ever shrink the vector to conserve memory. Not much memory is used by the vector.
		 This will help speed up any future additions to the vector as well.
	-Sorted insert in order to use binary search
